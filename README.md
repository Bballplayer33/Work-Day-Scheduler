## Discribtion
  Create a day planner that user can interact with and also changes color as the hour passes, also the user can save events in the text box.

## Usage

![alt text](assets/screens/showing-saved.png)
  *Saved data. 

![alt text](assets/screens/all-fields.png)
  *All text boxes filled. 

![alt text](assets/screens/time-and-date.png)
  *Showing time and date. 

![alt text](assets/screens/showing-delete.png)
  *Showing saved deleted fields. 

## Conclusion
  I was able to save events to local storage, still working on the coloring changing with the hour as the time goes. Biggest challenge was figuring out the for loop and getting the arrays.
